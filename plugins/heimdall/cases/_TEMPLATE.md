# Case file — <range>

> is gitignored here; hand it over and let the recipient own its retention.

## Notes

<!-- What Heimdall scribbles at the whiteboard: the gist, in plain English, as
     you would say it aloud. Reproduced verbatim in the conversation inside a
     fence, so it must read on its own.

     NO rule ids, no symbols, no strip, no frame words (violation, pass,
     severity, not applicable). Those are the case file's and the strip's job.
     One screen, about five paragraphs, no headings.

     Cover this ground in this order, as prose: what stands · what dissolved on
     reading and why · what we could not look at and why · what we could not
     tell and what would settle it · the one question worth asking. The style
     rules are in the profile skill: spoken register, nothing that grades, no
     frame words, no names, "the record does not show" rather than "there is
     no". -->

```
CODENAME — <the period, in words>

<what stands, in plain terms>

<what looked bad and was not, and why>

<what we could not look at here, and why — never omitted>

<what the record cannot settle, and what would settle it>

<the question worth putting to the work>
```

## Coverage at a glance

<!-- Technical output, beside the technical record. Not in the notes. -->

```
<bin/case-strip output for this reading>
```

## Scope

<What was assessed: how many commits, which files, and anything about the range
that affects how the rest should be read. If the range was given rather than
derived, say so — a reader cannot otherwise tell.>

## Rules applied

| Rule | Title | Severity | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-00N | <title> | blocking | violation |
| R-00N | <title> | warning | pass |
| R-00N | <title> | advisory | not applicable |

Outcomes are `pass`, `violation`, or `not applicable`. **Not applicable is not a
pass** — it means the increment does not touch what the rule governs.

## Findings

### R-00N — <rule title>

**Severity:** blocking
**Where:** `path/to/file.ext:42` at `<ref>`

**The rule requires:** <quote or paraphrase the rule's statement — the recipient
may not have Heimdall's checkout, and a bare rule id is not actionable.>

**What is there:**

```
<the offending code, quoted>
```

**Why this violates it:** <one or two sentences. Not a fix — a fix is the
recipient's to decide.>

<!-- Repeat per finding, most severe first. -->

## Observations

<Things worth saying that no active rule covers. Label them as unruled. If an
observation recurs across increments, that is a signal a rule may be missing —
say so, but do not treat it as a violation.>

## Not checked

<What this assessment did not cover, and why: rules that are draft, parts of the
diff not read, things not visible from the evidence available. Silence here
reads as coverage, so an empty section must be an explicit "nothing".>
