## Statement

Where a repository types its subjects — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
`ci:`, `build:`, `style:` and kin — a landing under a **restrictive** type
must not carry substantial content the type cannot hold: a `docs:` landing
that changes the repository's source, a `test:` landing that changes the
thing under test, a `ci:` or `build:` landing that changes source outside
tooling paths, a `style:` landing whose lines do not survive whitespace
removal unchanged.

The claim is about the label. Not that the content was wrong, not that it
should have been split — only that a reader who trusted the type never
looked, and the type gave them no reason to.

**Scope: conditional on the convention.** Below half of the window's
landings typed, or fewer than ten, typed subjects are not this repository's
practice and the outcome is **not applicable**.

**Scope: restrictive types only.** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf` and
`chore` may carry anything by their own meaning and are never candidates.

**Where source and tests live is the repository's own statement**, read from
where its typed landings go. A directory reached by test-typed landings at
least twice as often as by feat/fix landings is a test home; the reverse is a
source home. A restrictive type is a candidate only for what it changes
inside a source home and outside a test home. Where no source home can be
learned, the rule **cannot tell** and says so.

**Floor: twenty-five source lines**, chosen.

## Rationale

P-12 holds that the record must describe the change it carries, and a typed
subject is the most explicit description a commit can give: it says which
kind of thing this is. A convention that types subjects is a convention that
invites readers to filter by type — to skip `docs:` and `test:` in a review
of behaviour, to trust `style:` without opening it — and that trust is only
as good as the typing.

The source-home mechanism exists because of the first run. Twelve `test:`
landings were reported for carrying source that was the repository's
end-to-end suite, under a directory name the shared classifier had no reason
to know. Learning the layout from churn share failed — good `fix:` commits
carry tests into the same directories — and learning it from which typed
landings *touch* which directories worked: 80% of `test:` landings against
35% of `fix:` for the suite, 26% against 99% for the package tree.

## How to check

```sh
bin/subject-content --since "6 months ago"
```

The script reports the typed share and the types in use, the source and test
homes it learned and from what, the restrictive-type landings examined, and
every candidate with the type, the straying line count and the subject.

Limitations to state in a case file:

- **The convention is recognised by its common form** — `type(scope)!: subject`
  with a known type word. A repository with its own vocabulary reads as
  untyped.
- **Homes are learned at two path levels** and need ten typed landings of
  each kind. A small window learns nothing and the rule cannot tell.
- **Doc comments inside source are source to the classifier.** A `docs:`
  landing that edits them will be listed; on the first history two of six
  survivors were exactly that.

## Evidence to cite

- The typed share, the homes learned, and the floor.
- The landing: its type, its subject, and what it changed in the source home
  — file and line count, and what kind of change it was on reading.
- What the subject should have said. A finding under this rule that cannot
  propose the honest label has not been adjudicated.

## Not a violation

- **Doc comments in source** under a `docs:` subject. The classifier cannot
  tell a comment from code; a reader can in a second.
- **A `test:` landing that exported or exposed something so it could be
  tested** — a small change to the subject in service of the test.
- **A `build:` or `ci:` change whose consequence propagates into source** —
  a stricter compiler setting that forces annotations everywhere, a bundler
  change that alters import forms. The label is honest about the cause; the
  content is its effect. Listed on the first history at 310 lines, and a
  reader should still see it.
- **A type used loosely by the repository's own convention** — `docs:` for
  anything user-facing, `test:` for anything under a test directory the
  home learning did not reach. Read the convention document before citing.
- **A `style:` landing that is a formatter run with a formatter that reorders**
  — imports sorted, keys reordered — which whitespace removal does not undo.

## History

- **Draft, on derivation.** The second rule under P-12, built in the house
  order on three histories: one typed throughout (1,135 landings, 100%),
  one partly typed (37%), one a hair under the bar (49.7%). The conditional
  stood down on the last two, the third by a rounding's width — which is
  what a bar at the knee looks like, and why the share is printed to a
  decimal. On the first, twenty candidates became six once the repository's
  own layout was learned from its own landings, and the six that remained
  were read and are the exemptions above plus one genuine build-setting
  cascade.

  Held at `draft`: the floor is chosen, the home learning has run on one
  history that has a convention, and every survivor so far was innocent on
  reading.
